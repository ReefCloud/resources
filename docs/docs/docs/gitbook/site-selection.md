# Site selection

The sites selection process is divided into two parts defined by the questions such as:

* Is this the first time we are surveys these reefs?
* If no, who has existing data and sites coordinates?
* Are we surveying the same sites or do we need new sites or a combination to meet collect the types of data required.
* What is the depth range targeted for this survey?
* How many days do we need to survey all sites?
* If the weather is not favourable or there are some unforeseen circumstances, how many sites should be targeted to complete within the timeframe?
* If such conditions occur, what is the trade-off between reducing the number of sites verse number of transect?

**Existing monitoring sites**

While working with existing monitoring sites it is recommended that:

* Use the coordinates to plot the sites on a map (you can use the mapping options in section 5.2.1).
* Identify sites that are absolutely needed and sites that can be optional;
* Is there a need to conduct surveys at all existing monitoring sites or do we need some new sites to answer the question(s);
* Rank the existing sites from high to low priority; and
* If needed, add the new sites coordinates.
* Once the sites have been prioritised, the coordinates for the sites (waypoints) can be extracted and entered into a handheld GPS to locate sites during surveys (if not in the GPS).

_**Note**_**:** _Local weather conditions, the number of days allocated for surveys and the level of comfort and expertise in the team are also important to consider for logistics and to safely conduct surveys._

#### **Selecting new sites.**

When working in areas never surveyed before or have no record of any data collection, the steps include:

* Gathering as much information as possible about the areas from locals and online sources. The types if information that are required for planning are dangerous animals, currents and currents, accessibility to sites, availability of boats, distance from mainland, boat guide with a good understanding of local conditions.
* Reviewing/exploring maps with local knowledge to identify areas that you may want to survey. If possible, use a map with more detailed features such as Allen Coral Atlas ([allencoralatlas.org](https://www.allencoralatlas.org/)) to understand the diversity of the reef system. This will assist with the site selection process by providing guidance towards target habitats, the estimated size and accessibility of reefs and the likelihood of finding the target habitats in the areas.
* Once the habitats have been identified, plot the sites on the map and rank them from high to low priority.
* The number of days allocated for surveys and the weather conditions play an important role in sites prioritisation process.
* Once the sites have been prioritised, the coordinates for the sites (waypoints) can be extracted and entered into a handheld GPS to locate sites during surveys.

_**Note:** The site selected for monitoring should be representative of the area of interest and contain the same habitats so comparable data can be gathered from different sites (2004 Hill and Wilkson)_
