# Planning your Surveys

There are many steps involved in planning and the initial and most important is defining a research question(s) and identifying the indicators the survey(s) will collect.&#x20;

Once a sampling design is developed, a sampling criterion on selecting sites can be derived by:

* The types of habitats to target to data collection;
* The number of sites within each habitat;
* The length of transects and number of transects per site so you know how much reef areas is needed for survey.
* The target reef zones;
* Sites close to population centres or rivers; and
* The indicators that the survey has targeted.

The next step would be to mark sites on the map and extract GPS coordinates for the survey. There are two ways of getting a better understanding of the reef system, (1) conducting a scoping survey of the area(s) on techniques like manta tow and (2) using habitat or details feature maps such as Google Earth ([https://shorturl.at/brGIU](https://shorturl.at/brGIU)), Allen Coral Atlas ([https://allencoralatlas.org/](https://allencoralatlas.org/)), using the sampling criteria to select sites. Additionally, a local tide chart and weather bulletin is also important to develop a daily workplan.
