# Sampling design and site selection for coral reef surveys

Marine ecosystems are changing at an alarming rate. The impacts of climate change and human activities are accelerating the changes to a level faster than marine ecosystems can cope with or adapt to. Coral reefs are one of the few ecosystems heavily impacted by climate and anthropogenic changes yet crucial to coastal residents and fisheries resources. Over the last few decades, monitoring changes in coral reef ecosystems have become critical to make informed management decisions to sustain the ecosystem services that coral reefs provide.

Coral reef field surveys generate data that can provide invaluable information on the current status of a reef. This information can aid in the development of management plans for fishing grounds/sea country, help prioritise threats to develop management/mitigation actions, identify ecologically important sites, confirm the status of cultural/traditional important sites and species, and assist coral reef-reliant communities manage their resources through evidence-based decisions.

An effective coral reef survey requires a careful sampling design that is about to meet the objectives and utilise indicators that most relate to the objectives. Sampling design is a process of developing a plan that is time-bound and logistical practical based on:

1\.    Why survey a reef system?

2\.    Where on the reef surveys should be conducted;

3\.    What to survey;

4\.    How to survey; and

5\.    What and who to consult for reliable and relevant information on the location/site.

Sampling design in any field research is a complex space, however, this guide aims to provide best practice guidelines on:

* Motivations for monitoring or why programs/communities feel there is a need to monitor/survey their reef systems
* Defining a research question that best suits the needs
* Identifying indicators to tell the story and address the research question
* Selecting the most appropriate sampling method
* Identifying suitable monitoring or assessment sites
* Logistics, timeframes, and limitations
