# Selecting the most appropriate coral survey method.

There are various sampling methods used for coral reef surveys. Some methods are specific for certain types of data collection while others are more widely used for general observation. Methods range from large-scale data coral reef surveys to area-specific surveys designed to answer specific questions. The most common coral reef survey methods can be divided into two categories, _in-situ_ diver surveys and diver surveys using technology for data collection.

The methods will also depend on the expertise of the team, site accessibility, availability of equipment, budget, and time. &#x20;

More information on the survey methods can be found in the appendix: Coral Reef Survey Methods.&#x20;
