# Representation and replication in sampling design

Sampling design and strategies are a way of capturing the right kind of information using the best techniques without surveying every single habitat across large areas. The sampling design focuses on capturing the state and processes that vary from location to location, at a spatial scale of large areas and over time. Some key considerations for sampling design include:

* Six to seven sites per location.
* Systematic selection of sites based on depth.
* Sites should be spaced out along the reef (\~ 1-2 km apart).
* Some random stations can be selected within sites to represent the area surveyed.
* Any historical data site should be incorporated into the design.
* The site should be **representative of the habitat** of interest so summary information provides an average of different habitats and is not biased towards one or two habitats.
* The size of a sampling unit/area (size of the quadrat or photo frame), the variability of habitats, and the overall size of reefs should be considered during the design phase.
* Sites would have **multiple replicates** (transects or surveys as identified in ReefCloud). Having replicates within sites minimises the influence of variability to some extent that is caused by small-scale differences in the reef structure, observer bias and inconsistency in data collection technique. Data for each site is an average of all the transects/surveys combined or the changes in each transect/survey can be monitored over time if they are conducted in the same geo-referenced area.
